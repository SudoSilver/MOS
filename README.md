So you decited to check out and possibly contribute to our kernel made from rust conviction and for educational purposes (for now).

Some important details:
  -Contributors should add their name or handle to our list of contributors 
  -The rust configurations such as bors.toml Cargo.toml rust-toolchain x86_64-no_std.json and config.toml are sourced from https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os
   but no code was taken from that repository although I do reccomend checking it out
